# What is LLDEX?

## Low Latency DEX Protocol

Low Latency DEX is Wallet2Wallet permissionless protocol to settle crypto trades between 2 counterparties. It allows users to agree on the price off-chain in a low latency environment and settle the trade on-chain.

The protocol can be used by two counterparties that would like to trade with each other and settle trades on-chain. 

### ü§ù General workflow

1. Market Maker is streaming prices to Market Taker
2. Market Taker is sending execution request to Market Maker
3. Maker Maker is approving the trade request and sending trade to the blockchain for trade settlement

To allow **low latency** execution workflow between 2 parties without compromising security, we implemented an additional key set on the market taker and on the market maker side. Information about keys used for low latency workflows is saved on the blockchain.

### ü§ù Market Maker

Rates streamed by Market Maker do not commit the Market Maker to confirm particular execution. It is up to the Market Maker to decide if the transaction can be sent to the blockchain. 

Designed workflow is allowing for risk-free position auto-hedging. If the hedge trade would not be possible at the given price, Market Maker can reject the execution request.

Market Maker should take care of the latency between the server that is streaming the price and the end client. Market Maker has full control over its reputation. Constant trade rejections will cause reputation damage.

### üë®‚Äçüåæ Market Takers

Market Taker is getting current prices from Market Maker. Market Taker is sending execution request to the Market Maker. 

To achieve low latency execution, Market Taker has a special key stored in the browser. Information about the current key is stored on the blockchain. Each key has validity time. The concept is taken from a regular authorization standard used by companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook.

Execution request is a data structure created off-chain \(ex. in the browser\) and signed according to [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) by the session key.

## Why we built Beta Finance

Shorting is a counter balancing force to price volatility and critical piece of financial infrastructure missing in DeFi. Rather than allow volatility to persist as the norm and depend on liquidation cascades for price corrections, we wanted to enable DeFi users to have the ability to act as an opposing force to price volatility by providing an simple and seamless experience to short assets. 

Additionally, currently &gt;99% of actively traded crypto assets are neglected by popular money market protocols, leaving these token holders with few or no options to earn additional yield on their tokens. As DeFi grows larger and larger, we wanted a money market protocol that could scale with it, where users were able to create money markets immediately. 

## 

## Project mission and vision

Our mission is to offset the volatility in DeFi today by developing critical infrastructure and user tooling to facilitate market efficiency. We stand by the DeFi ethos of "Open Finance For All" and seek to re-define finance by providing a foundational block in DeFi that future projects will be built upon.
