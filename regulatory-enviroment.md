* "The DeFi Swap protocol (“Protocol”) is a set of smart contracts made available by DeFi Labs (“Crypto.com”) on a voluntary, “as-is” and “as available” basis. By interacting or attempting to interact (in both cases, “interacting”) with the Protocol, you confirm that you understand and agree to these Protocol Terms."



CoinClear is a smart contract (similar to a regular ERC20 contract that is creating virtual assets) that enables ‘Peer-to-peer’ (P2P) transactions without the use or involvement of a VASP or other obliged entity, such as VA transfers between two unhosted wallets.

Virtual Asset transfers done with the use of CoinClear smart contract can be done between counterparties on the pre-agreed rate between particular assets.

Thanks to the design regulators in different jurisdictions know exactly who transferred the asset to whom and are free to investigate any the origination of funds.

The smart contract is open-sourced under MIT licence. We are not responsible for any damages related to the use of this smart contract.

Peer-to-peer transactions 34.&#x20;

‘Peer-to-peer’ (P2P) transactions are VA transfers conducted without the use or involvement of a VASP or other obliged entity, such as VA transfers between two unhosted wallets. P2P transactions are not explicitly subject to AML/CFT obligations under the FATF Recommendations. This is because the FATF Recommendations generally place obligations on intermediaries between individuals and the financial system, rather than on individuals themselves with some exceptions, such as requirements related to targeted financial sanctions. This is similar to the approach taken with physical fiat currency (cash) transactions, although there are inherent differences between VA transfers and physical cash transfers.
